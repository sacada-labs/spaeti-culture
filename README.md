## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm** (or **yarn**/ **pnpm**)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sacada-labs/sit-in-spaeti.git
cd sit-in-spaeti
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The dev server supports hot module replacement (HMR), so changes will be reflected immediately.

### Build

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist/` directory, optimized and minified for deployment.

### Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the built files from the `dist/` directory, allowing you to test the production build before deploying.

## Data
